With the pandemic flying high on our radars, we as a society have been through lots of hardships. Paranoia, fear, and boredom are at an all-time high. Our lifestyles have taken a steep curve, and adaptation has been an ongoing issue.

Through the year and a quarter, we have tried to move around trying to avoid the virus by changing our habits and everyday activities. But, how do we know how safe we are with the way we currently live?

### **Introducing The Covid-Purity Test**

With this serious yet satirical test, your lifestyle and habits can determine how "pure" you are from the virus. Do you wash your hands? Do you eat corn? Questions like these can show how prone you are to being affected by the virus. But fear not, in the event of a *low* purity test, our accurate data on covid centres, appointments, and vaccinations will be provided to you. (It's not all jokes and laughs on this side)
